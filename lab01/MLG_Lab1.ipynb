    "In this laboratory you are going to learn how to perform interactive computing using **jupyter**. The **jupyter** project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014, evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. It was initially an interactive shell for python that has more functionnalities than the basic one, now it allows you to interact with your scripts using a what they called **notebooks**. The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide does not start from the basics of the general purpose language **python**. If you do not know this language, it is recommended to follow a **python** tutorial in order to learn the basic concepts and commands.
